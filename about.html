                Hello! My name is Matthew Bloemer, and I am an electrical engineering student at Oregon Institute of Technology located in Portland, Oregon. I have an anticipated
                graduation date of June 2023 with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. I currently hold a 3.84 GPA, and I am 
                actively searching for an internship for the summer of 2022. Please contact me at <span id="email-link">bloemer.matthew@gmail.com</span> with any 
                job opportunities or questions!
                <br>
                <br>
                Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to do some sort of engineering. I loved building and designing things with Legos and Rokenbok, and I put together my first
                computer at the age of 12. I liked working with my hands, so I decided to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University. After a year,
                I realized this wasn't the path for me, but I really enjoyed 3D modeling and I have kept this up as a hobby.  I took a break from school, and worked as a CNC machinist setting up and running CNC lathes and mills. Even though I enjoyed
                my job, I could still feel a pull towards the field of engineering. After doing some research on the different fields of engineering, I decided to buy myself
                an Arduino starter kit. I immediately fell in love with building a circuit, writing some code, and seeing how the code affected the physical circuit. I realized
                that this is the exact kind of work I had been looking for, and the rest is history! Now that I am in my junior year, I have taken many electrical engineering 
                courses and they have only furthered my interest in the field. My favorite courses have focused on microcontrollers and circuit design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I decided to create this site to showcase the different types of projects I have worked on. This site was created using vanilla HTML and CSS.
                <br>
                <br>
                I frequently update the site with my ongoing projects, so check in regularly to see what I am up to!
