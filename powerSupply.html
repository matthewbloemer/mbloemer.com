        <p class="project-entry-text">
            This project's goal is to design an AC to DC variable power supply. The design parameters required the power supply to be externally adjustable, with the operating
            voltage range to be from 5 V to 10 V. The maximum output current for this power supply is 500 mA. There is short-circuit protection built in, so no components would
            get damaged if the output terminals are shorted. Since this is a school project for my electronics class, I am not allowed to use a monolithic IC voltage regulator,
            such as an LT317, to regulate the output voltage. Once the power supply is built and tested, I will design a PCB for the circuit and have it fabricated. Finally, I 
            plan to 3D model a housing for the power supply circuit, which would increase the safety of the circuit and would be much more visually appealing.

        <h2 class="project-entry-subtitle">Project Status</h2>
        <p class="project-entry-text">
            As of November 2021, the circuit schematic has been finalized and constructed in LTSpice, which is the schematic shown above. Preliminary simulations have been ran
            on the circuit, and promising results have been obtained. According to the early simulations, the power supply can operate between 4.2 V and 10.6 V comfortably.
            Additionally, the maximum output current is at 550 mA. These results exceed the expectations of the circuit. Components have been orderded, and the next step is to
            build the physical circuit and obtain experimental results. I expect that some resistance values will have to be changed in order to obtain desired functionality, 
            specifically the current sensing resistor R4.
